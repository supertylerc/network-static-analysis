# Security Issues and Disclosures

Package dependencies from this project are updated regularly, and basic
security scans are performed using both `safety` and `bandit`.  This
should result in the `master` branch always having up-to-date
dependencies, thereby mitigating the potential for third-party security
issues at least a little bit.

If you believe you have encountered a potential security issue, please
do not open an issue on GitHub.  Reach out to me at `code@tylerc.me` to
discuss the issue.  This will help protect end users long enough for a
fix to be released.
